# aem-sass-compiler

Currently AEM's built-in CSS framework support is limited to normal CSS and an old version of Less. The old version of Less can't be upgraded easily as LESS dropped support for the old Rhino implementation that it's built on. This version is meant to be more of a research project, but with eventually full support of Sass in AEM. I'm hoping to be able to extend what I learn from this to also add ES6 support.

The other alternative to this plugin is to use a setup similar to https://github.com/Redorb/AEM-Future it's a bit more clunky but it's been tested in a production project and works easily after the initial setup.

## Installation

Right now there isn't much to install until I get the initial prototype working, when that happens I'll put it up on clojars so you can add it to your maven/gradle/lein buildfiles.

## Usage

I'm invision something similar to the Less compiler built into aem where you just make the files like normal and it's compiled into clientlibs automatically.
